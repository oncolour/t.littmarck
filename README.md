# Start Project

## To Get started simply clone the repo.
`git clone https://github.com/oncolour/Start.git`

After cloning the repo cd into it using
`cd Start`

When inside the Start folder, the only thing needed to get up and runin is to run:
`npm install`

And there you go, now you should have a fully functional starting template running SASS, Cssmin, Imagemin, Uglify and watch.

#### Good luck!
